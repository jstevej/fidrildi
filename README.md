# Fiðrildi

Fiðrildi 3 is a 34-key, ortholinear, butterfly-shaped, unibody split keyboard inspired by [Reviung](https://github.com/gtips/reviung), [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd), and others.

QMK support is in the ["steve" branch of my QMK repo](https://github.com/jstevej/qmk_firmware/tree/steve)

The hardware is a work-in-progress, but will converge soon on a final version -- hopefully version 4.

Versions:

- Version 1: Inspired by the [MT3 Lord of the Rings keycaps](https://matt3o.com/the-tolkien-keycaps-are-finally-live/).
- Version 2: Eronomic tweaks, Cirque trackpad, GC9A01 display, rotary encoder, and side-mount LEDs on the bottom of the PCB. Requires [0xcb Helios](https://github.com/0xCB-dev/0xCB-Helios) MCU.
- Version 3: Ergonomic tweaks, peripheral support via 4-pin and 8-pin JST SH (1 mm) connectors, switch to reverse-mount LEDs and acrylic middle layer. Requires [0xcb Helios](https://github.com/0xCB-dev/0xCB-Helios) MCU.
- Version 4: Coming soon. Based on version 3 with ergonomic tweaks, keeps the reverse-mount LEDs and acrylic, remove the 4-pin JST connector, adds rotary encoder. Requires [0xcb Helios](https://github.com/0xCB-dev/0xCB-Helios) MCU.
